We've used the pretrained models :

For Recognizing Objects in Images:
faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_coco_2017_11_08
(Accuracy is preferred over Response Time)

For Recognizing Objects in Live Video Feed (Webcam):
ssd_inception_v2_coco_2017_11_17
(Response Time is preffered over Accuracy)

For Transfer Learning:
ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2017_11_17
(Response Time is highly preffered over the accuracy for Training the models.)
(The model was not completely trained and it was implemented in the halfway of its training process.)


The models can be downloaded from :
